# Portfolio

Since I'm starting my freelance business, I really need to be able to show my future clients what I can do for them. I really liked the simplicity of TailwindCSS when making my resume, I'm using it again here, with a good friend of mine : VueJS.

## Usage
To start the dev mode run :
```bash
npm run dev
```
